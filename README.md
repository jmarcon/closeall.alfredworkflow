Some times, when you let your mac online for a long time without human intervention, it will accumulate alert notifications...

You could use the "Notification Center" and click over the close/x button in the "Today" section.

But, you know... It's 2 or 3 clicks ;-)

Now you can just tell you alfred to close it for you!
